# threejs-boilerplate-shader

This is a boilerplate project made for testing shaders in
[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). This is a copy of the
[threejs-boilerplate](https://github.com/olejrosendahl/threejs-boilerplate) I clone when I want to test a new shader.

[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) will be updated upon
every release.
